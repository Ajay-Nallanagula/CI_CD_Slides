Jenkins is CI tool, it monitors VCS(git) start and monitor a build system if changes occur
Jenkins provides reports notifications alerts on success or error

CI/CD(Delivery)
CI dev practice , commit dev changes to dev repo several times a day, every commit made is then built this allows to detect problems early
CD(Deployment) : continous deployment, sucessful build will be deployed automatically
CD(Delivery): its slightly diff from Continous deployment business decides when to deploy changes rather than IT team deciding it, its manual it can be scheduled

Jargon
Policing, checking the changes by jenkins

Artifact Repository, contains the binaries, dll's only . It doesn't contain source code. in .net terms Build Package will be saved here, from here it will move to Deployment Servers. 
Artifact Repositories contain versioning here, Ex usage like Nexus, JFrog etc
